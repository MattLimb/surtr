# surtr

A Rust Implementation of SURTs based off of the Internet Archive's [Python Implementation](https://github.com/internetarchive/surt).

It aims to be as close to 100% compatiable as possible.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a first draft implementation. THIS IS NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION CODE.


TODO:
    - Build Pipelines to make PySurtr wheels
    - Look into building pipelines to automate the go_surtr library generation.
